# SQLDatabase Dictionary
An interactive english dictionary with python and SQL, pulling from an offsite database.
### Prerequisites
We need sql-connector and Python 3

First you will need to install mysql if it is not installed already:
'''
pip install mysql-python
'''
Next install the driver:

'''
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
'''
Once these are installed, we can move forward with downloading the repository and running the program.

## Deployment

This could be applied in an online dictionary as well as any potential spell correction system.

## Built With

* [python3](https://www.python.org) - Language used
* [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database Management
